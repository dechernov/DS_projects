| Definition of a successful game platform and game product  | An online store that sells computer games around the world, is planning an advertising campaign based on a potentially popular product. | Pandas, matplotlib, scipy | Finished |

**Objective:** define a potentially popular product.

**Tasks:** define the relevant time period to determine the factors that influence sales; identify the most potentially profitable platforms, genres, and geographies; and determine the factors that influence sales volume.

**Summary:** 
* Focus on North America and Europe to increase profitability of business. Japan accounts for ~10% of sales. Considering the lifecycle of the platforms (the analysis showed that the platforms last 10 years on average), the xone and ps4 are potentially profitable in the Americas. For the European region, marketing resources should be focused on the Xone, PS4 and PC (as the most stable players). The potentially lucrative genres in America and Europe are shooters and sports (market share in America 38.5%, in Europe 35.3%).

* Critics' scores have the greatest impact on sales. The range of correlation coefficients between sales volume and critics' scores for these platforms is from 0.21 to 0.46. In this case, to increase the profitability of the store, it is necessary to focus on game titles that receive higher scores from critics (~70 points out of 100).

* It should be noted that user behavior differs slightly from region to region. For example, in Japan they prefer character development games (Japan has a long and rich history of producing games in this genre). Presumably, this leads to the difference in preferred platforms in different regions - for example, sports games are more convenient to play on consoles. In this regard, the Xbox and PS platforms are the most popular in North America and Europe.

* Regarding the average user ratings of the Xone and PC platforms, although they are unequal (average user rating for Xone: ~6.5, while average user rating for PC: ~6.3), the p-value obtained in the statistical test (28.3%) indicates that this or a greater difference could be obtained by chance. This allows us to accept the null hypothesis that the average ratings of the Xone and PC platforms are equal. Thus, for example, marketing resources should be focused on the Xone and PC platforms (if their popularity increases) according to their market shares.

* As for the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres, they differ from each other. The average user rating for Action: is ~6.9, while the average user rating for Sports: is ~5.2. A statistical test rejected the hypothesis that the average ratings of the two platforms are equal. Therefore, marketing resources should be focused on the action genre.
