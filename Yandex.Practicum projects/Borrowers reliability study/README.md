**Objective:** it is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children in the client's family affect the fact of timely repayment of the loan.

**Summary:**
* The most pronounced trend in changes in the number of debtors can be observed with an increase in the number of children in the family. As the number of children grows, the proportion of clients with debts increases.

* Another trend associated with changes in the number of debtors can be observed with an increase in the income of the client. With the growth of income - the share of clients in arrears decreases.

* The marital status of the client does not influence the probability of loan repayment. The smallest share of debtors is among divorced and widowed clients. The largest share of debtors is among clients who are married and unmarried. This suggests that there is no direct relationship between being in a relationship and repaying a loan (which could mean having a common family budget and therefore more money to repay the loan).  

* The lowest percentage of debtors is among clients who buy real estate. This behavior can probably be explained by the fact that real estate is a vital necessity and in case of default on loan payment there is a risk of repossession of the property by the bank.

* As for the data - the bank should improve the quality of information processing about the client, possibly increase the automation of its processing and add a data set about the amount of credit needed for a more detailed understanding of the client's behavior.
