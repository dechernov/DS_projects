**Objective:** it is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children in the client's family affect the fact of timely repayment of the loan.

**Tasks:**  1. Data verification.
 2. Data pre-processing.
 3. Hypothesis testing.

**Summary:**
We tested three hypotheses and concluded that

1. The day of the week has a different effect on user activity in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The first hypothesis was fully confirmed.

2. Musical preferences do not change much during the week in either Moscow or St. Petersburg. There are slight differences at the beginning of the week, on Mondays:
* in Moscow they listen to "world" music,
* In St. Petersburg they listen to jazz and classical music.

Thus, the second hypothesis was only partially confirmed. The result could have been different if there were no missing values in the data.

3. The tastes of Moscow and St. Petersburg users have more similarities than differences. Contrary to expectations, genre preferences in St. Petersburg were similar to those in Moscow.

The third hypothesis was rejected. If there are differences in preferences, they are not noticeable for the majority of users.
